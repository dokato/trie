Trie
=====
Simple python implementation of [Trie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) tree data structure also known as *digital tree*, sometimes *radix tree* or *prefix tree*. Efficient when keeping string clues.

It was done as a part of the semester project for "Algorithms and data structers" subject on University of Warsaw.
